INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN  THE LCD_ADC.c PROGRAM

--> The connection from the Beaglebone to the LCD and the ADC is as follows:
BBB         LCD
P9_12       E
P9_13       RS
P9_15       DB4
P8_11       DB5
P8_12       DB6
P8_14       DB7

BBB         ADC
P9_32       Vcc
P9_34       GND
P9_33       Data

--> Before compiling, the following ports have to be configured
-- You need to do it only once, after each beaglebone power up

- This line is to activate the ADC
echo cape-bone-iio > /sys/devices/bone_capemgr.*/slots

-- The following 12 lines are to configure the 6 pins used to control the LCD
echo 60 > /sys/class/gpio/export
echo out > /sys/class/gpio/gpio60/direction
echo 26 > /sys/class/gpio/export
echo out > /sys/class/gpio/gpio26/direction
echo 44 > /sys/class/gpio/export
echo out > /sys/class/gpio/gpio44/direction
echo 45 > /sys/class/gpio/export
echo out > /sys/class/gpio/gpio45/direction
echo 48 > /sys/class/gpio/export
echo out > /sys/class/gpio/gpio48/direction
echo 31 > /sys/class/gpio/export
echo out > /sys/class/gpio/gpio31/direction

--> This line compiles the code contained in LCD_ADC.c and creates an a.out archive
gcc beagle_gpio.c beagle_hd44780.c LCD_ADC.c

--> Finally, this line executes the code compiled above
./a.out
